SERVER WARS: DOMINION PROTOCOL - PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Phase: Preparation (Phase 0)
Last Updated: 2026-01-26
Status: Planning Phase - No Implementation Yet

================================================================================
1. CORE CONCEPT (LOCKED)
================================================================================

Project Type: Multi-Server Discord Bot Game
Genre: Persistent Global Simulation / Grand Strategy
Scale: Cross-server competitive gameplay

Core Mechanics:
- Each Discord server = One Nation/Faction
- Server members = Citizens of that nation
- Shared global world where all servers interact
- Competition through: War, Diplomacy, Espionage, Economy, Politics
- Scheduled conflicts (not spam-based)
- Long-term progression with seasonal resets

Key Differentiators:
- NOT a card game bot
- NOT anime-focused
- Inter-server rivalry is the core hook
- Community coordination required
- Persistent world with consequences
- Strategic depth over mechanical complexity

================================================================================
2. CORE PILLARS (DESIGN PRINCIPLES)
================================================================================

Pillar 1: INTER-SERVER RIVALRY
- Servers must have reasons to compete
- Visible rankings and achievements
- Public victories and defeats
- Drama and conflict drive engagement

Pillar 2: COMMUNITY COORDINATION
- Individual actions contribute to server success
- Leadership roles with meaningful power
- Citizens must work together strategically
- Internal politics and succession systems

Pillar 3: SCHEDULED CONFLICT
- Wars have preparation, execution, and resolution phases
- Cooldowns prevent spam and burnout
- Time zones considered in major events
- Clear windows for action

Pillar 4: LONG-TERM PROGRESSION
- Seasonal resets with legacy rewards
- Persistent reputation and history
- Server identity carries across seasons
- Statistics and achievements tracked

================================================================================
3. STRATEGIC INPUTS (STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES)
================================================================================

GALE (Integrator - Scope & Viability):
- Keep scope controlled and achievable
- Solve "empty world problem" early (need critical mass)
- Prioritize MVP depth over feature breadth
- Incremental rollout strategy

ODIN (Logic & Stability - Systems Design):
- Succession mechanics for leadership continuity
- Anti-abuse systems for alliances (prevent mega-alliances)
- Ensure monetization is visibly non-pay-to-win
- Balanced progression and power curves

LOKI (Growth & Monetization - Market Fit):
- Lean into public conflict and drama for virality
- Visibility = growth (public leaderboards, war reports)
- Status-based monetization (cosmetics, titles, prestige)
- NOT power-based monetization

IRIS (Community & Identity - Player Experience):
- Players must feel like citizens, not just users
- Lore, identity, culture, and storytelling matter
- Seasonal themes with narrative elements
- Legacy rewards that tell a story
- Server culture and personality

STATISTICS SAM (Evidence & Reality - Business Model):
- Server-paid model > individual user-paid
- Expect 1-3% server conversion rate (realistic)
- Retention is harder than acquisition
- Churn prevention is critical
- Need engagement loops that keep players returning

================================================================================
4. CONSTRAINTS & BOUNDARIES
================================================================================

Development Constraints:
- Single developer (solo development)
- High system complexity with many interdependencies
- Need for incremental rollout capability
- Must be maintainable long-term

Technical Constraints:
- Discord API limitations and rate limits
- Must work on mobile AND desktop Discord
- Database performance at scale
- Scheduled task reliability

Design Constraints:
- Command-driven interface (Discord slash commands)
- Almost all mechanics must be command-accessible
- No "dead" or novelty commands
- Every command must synergize with game loop

Phase 0 Constraints:
- PLANNING ONLY - No implementation yet
- No over-engineering
- Documentation must be executable later
- Focus on clarity and structure

================================================================================
5. SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PREPARATION PHASE
================================================================================

At the end of Phase 0, the developer must have:

✓ Complete project phase breakdown (what to build when)
✓ Justified development methodology choice
✓ Step-by-step developer roadmap (tools to deployment)
✓ Configurability system design (control features post-launch)
✓ Complete command list with synergies mapped
✓ Core system architecture plans
✓ Reworked prize/incentive system
✓ Clear scope boundaries for each phase
✓ Risk identification and mitigation strategies

The developer should know:
- Exactly what to build
- In what order to build it
- What to delay for later phases
- How to scale safely
- How to control rollout

================================================================================
6. PROJECT IDENTITY
================================================================================

Tone: Serious strategy with emergent drama
Theme: Nations, power, legacy, betrayal, glory
Feel: Grand strategy meets Discord community game
Audience: Strategy gamers, community leaders, competitive players

This is NOT:
- A casual mini-game collection
- A pay-to-win gacha system
- A single-server experience
- A meme bot with game features

This IS:
- A persistent world with real stakes
- A community-driven competitive experience
- A platform for emergent stories
- A long-term engagement system
