4. RETENTION-DRIVEN
   - Rewards encourage continued play
   - Long-term engagement incentivized

================================================================================
7. PRIZE POOL FUNDING STRATEGY
================================================================================

SUSTAINABLE FUNDING:

Phase 1 (MVP - Phase 2-3): NO PRIZES
- Focus on gameplay and retention
- Build community first
- Test systems thoroughly
- No financial burden on developer

Phase 2 (Seasons Launch - Phase 4): MINIMAL PRIZES
- Status and cosmetic rewards only
- Developer provides premium features as prizes
- Cost: Time only, no cash
- Build prize culture

Phase 3 (Post-Monetization - Phase 5+): SCALED PRIZES
- Use 20% of premium subscription revenue for prizes
- Discord Nitro partnerships (reach out to Discord)
- Gaming platform partnerships (Steam, Epic, etc.)
- Sponsor small prize pools
- Community donation option (optional)

Example Revenue Math:
- 100 servers playing
- 3% conversion = 3 premium servers
- Average $15/month = $45/month revenue
- 20% to prizes = $9/month prize pool
- Sustainable, but small initially

GROWTH MODEL:
As bot grows to 1000+ servers:
- 30 premium servers × $15 = $450/month
- 20% to prizes = $90/month
- Can offer Discord Nitro to top 3 winners
- Plus status rewards for top 25%

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:
- Approach Discord for Nitro partnership
- Gaming companies for game key prizes
- Server hosting for free hosting prizes
- Gaming peripheral companies
